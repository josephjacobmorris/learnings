# K3
**K3s** is a **lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution** designed for **resource-constrained environments** like edge computing, IoT devices, or development/test scenarios. It was originally developed by **Rancher Labs** (now part of SUSE).

---

### 🔹 What is K3s?

K3s is essentially a **simplified version of Kubernetes (K8s)**:

* **Single binary** < 100 MB
* Removes or replaces non-essential features (e.g., etcd replaced by SQLite by default)
* Adds auto-deployment features and simplified networking and storage options

It’s fully compliant with CNCF’s Kubernetes specification, so it's not a different system—just a **lightweight implementation**.

### 🔹 Use Cases of K3s

| Use Case                     | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Edge Computing               | Deploying K8s at edge sites like factories, stores, or remote offices    |
| IoT                          | Running containerized workloads on small devices like Raspberry Pi       |
| CI/CD & Testing Environments | Fast setup of dev/test clusters on local machines                        |
| Lightweight Cloud Solutions  | Use in minimal VMs for dev/demo apps or multi-cluster POC environments   |
| Bare Metal/VMs               | Great for clusters without a full cloud stack or minimal OS environments |

### 🔹 Pros of K3s

| Advantage              | Explanation                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Lightweight          | Less CPU, RAM, disk usage (minimal dependencies)                     |
| ✅ Simple Installation  | Single binary install, no need to configure kubeadm manually         |
| ✅ Fast Startup         | Faster boot times, ideal for dynamic or ephemeral environments       |
| ✅ ARM Support          | Works well on ARM architectures like Raspberry Pi                    |
| ✅ SQLite Support       | Allows you to run without etcd for small-scale scenarios             |
| ✅ Fully CNCF Compliant | You can still use kubectl, Helm, etc.                                |
| ✅ Embedded Components  | Comes bundled with containerd, flannel, CoreDNS, etc. for easy setup |

### 🔹 Cons of K3s

| Disadvantage                | Explanation                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Not Meant for Large Scale | Not suitable for production workloads at massive scale                    |
| ❌ SQLite Limitation         | SQLite is not ideal for multi-node HA setups (can be switched to etcd)    |
| ❌ Limited Ecosystem         | Fewer built-in integrations than full Kubernetes distributions            |
| ❌ Less Fine-Grained Control | Some features are abstracted or removed (e.g., cloud controller managers) |
| ❌ Fewer Enterprise Features | Not a replacement for hardened enterprise K8s like OpenShift or EKS       |

### 🔹 K3s vs K8s (Kubernetes)

| Feature/Aspect             | K3s                                    | Kubernetes (K8s)                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Binary Size**            | \~100 MB (single binary)               | Hundreds of MBs (multiple components)     |
| **Installation**           | Single command (`k3s install`)         | kubeadm, kops, or custom setup            |
| **Database**               | SQLite (default), or etcd              | etcd only (for HA setup)                  |
| **Dependencies**           | Minimal (includes containerd, flannel) | Requires separate container runtime, CNI  |
| **System Requirements**    | Very low (512MB RAM+)                  | Higher (2GB RAM+ recommended)             |
| **HA Configuration**       | Optional external DB; less robust      | Stronger HA and clustering features       |
| **Use Case**               | Edge, IoT, local dev/test              | Full-scale production and cloud-native    |
| **Cloud Provider Support** | Limited/bundled or custom              | Full support with plugins and controllers |
| **Performance**            | Faster on small environments           | Scalable and robust for large workloads   |

### ✅ When to Use K3s?

* You want a quick Kubernetes setup for **local development**
* You are deploying to **edge locations or IoT devices**
* You don’t need advanced K8s enterprise features or complex HA setups
* You're experimenting with Kubernetes without managing all the complexity

---

### ❌ When to Prefer Full K8s?

* You need **robust multi-node HA**, RBAC, or advanced networking/storage plugins
* You're deploying to **large clusters in production**
* You require **full support from cloud providers or service meshes**
* You need **fine-grained control** over cluster configuration
