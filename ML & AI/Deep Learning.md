# Deep Learning

## Introduction

Deep Learning is a **subfield of Machine Learning** that focuses on using **artificial neural networks with many layers** ("deep" networks) to automatically learn patterns, features, and representations from raw data.

Instead of manually designing features (like in traditional machine learning), deep learning models **learn hierarchical feature representations** directly from data, often achieving **human-level or superhuman performance** in many domains.

### Key Ideas of Deep Learning:

1. **Neural Networks**

    * Inspired by how the human brain works.
    * Consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
    * Each neuron applies a mathematical transformation (weights + activation function).

2. **Deep Architectures**

    * "Deep" means many hidden layers (not just one or two).
    * Each layer captures higher-level abstractions:

        * Early layers → detect simple patterns (edges in an image).
        * Middle layers → detect complex patterns (shapes, textures).
        * Later layers → detect high-level concepts (faces, objects, words).

3. **Representation Learning**

    * Learns features automatically instead of requiring manual feature engineering.
    * Example: In speech recognition, the model learns to go from raw audio → phonemes → words.

4. **Massive Data & Compute**

    * Requires large datasets and high computing power (GPUs/TPUs).
    * Works best when lots of labeled or unlabeled data is available.


### Common Deep Learning Architectures:

* **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)** → Basic structure.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** → Excellent for images and vision tasks.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, GRUs** → Sequence tasks like speech, text, time series.
* **Transformers** → State-of-the-art in NLP (e.g., GPT, BERT) and also used in vision.
* **Autoencoders & GANs** → Unsupervised learning, data generation.

### Applications of Deep Learning:

* Image recognition (face ID, medical imaging).
* Natural language processing (translation, chatbots, GPT).
* Speech recognition (Siri, Alexa).
* Autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars).
* Recommender systems (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon).
* Drug discovery, healthcare, finance, robotics.
