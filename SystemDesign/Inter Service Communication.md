# Inter Service Communication

## Different modes

**API Architectural Styles:**

1. **RESTful**: A widely adopted, stateless approach using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with APIs.
2. **SOAP**: An XML-based protocol that enables secure, reliable communication between systems, ideal for enterprise-grade applications and complex transactions.
3. **GraphQL**: A query language that fetches only the required data, reducing over/under-fetching and improving performance.
4. **gRPC**: A high-performance protocol built on Protocol Buffers, providing efficient and real-time communication with lightweight support.
5. **WebSockets**: A persistent, bidirectional communication mechanism for real-time updates, suitable for applications requiring low-latency interactions (e.g., chat services).
6. **MQTT** (Message Queue Telemetry Transport): A lightweight messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth IoT devices and real-time data delivery.
